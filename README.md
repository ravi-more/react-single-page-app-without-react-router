# Single-Page Application without React Router

This is a simple single-page application (SPA) built using React without relying on React Router or any third-party libraries.

## Description

Creating a single-page application (SPA) in React without using React Router is possible, though it's a less common approach.

In a typical SPA, React Router is often used to manage different views and facilitate navigation between them. However, this project demonstrates an alternative approach that achieves similar behavior without any third-party dependencies.

### Key Features

- **Component-Based Structure:** This project organizes the application into components, each representing a different view or page.

- **Client-Side Routing:** Instead of using React Router, client-side routing is implemented using JavaScript to change the URL of the browser without triggering a full page reload.

- **No Third-Party Component Library:** In this project, third-party component libraries are not used, ensuring a lightweight and customized development approach.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ravi-more/react-single-page-app-without-react-router.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd react-single-page-app-without-react-router
    ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the development server.

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

You can add and modify components as needed to build your SPA.

## Usage
